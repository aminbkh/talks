Hi all,

I spent some time over winter break thinking about DAQ and manpower issues, and
found the NSF "Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation - SSE & SSI"
grant. I think it might be possible for CDMS to apply to this grant, with the aim
of getting funding for at least one full-time postdoc for three years.

### Money #########
The award amounts are fairly lucrative. SSE grants provide a maximum of $500K over
three years. SSI grants provide between $200K and $1M per year for three to five
years. (http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16532/nsf16532.htm)

### However #########
These software grants generally support work that benefits an entire field; it's
rare that work restricted to a single collaboration recieves funding. To get a
sense of what projects are typically funded, see
https://sites.google.com/site/softwarecyberinfrastructure/software/software and
http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/simpleSearchResult?queryText=SI2&ActiveAwards=true.

I think we may be able to make a competitive proposal by collaborating with a
group working on more general-purpose DAQ code.  MIDAS is perhaps an obvious
collaboration to consider.  Another option to consider is the nuclear-physics DAQ
team that's gearing up to support FRIB (https://www.phy.ornl.daq.gov/fribdaq).

### Worth it? #########
While there's money we can apply for, we'd need to hammer out a collaboration with
a more-generally-applicable DAQ group. Work on specific software like MIDAS is
most appropriate to the SSE grant, which is due April 26. More general work like
developing standards for DAQ interoperability is more appropriate to the SSI
grant, which is due September 19.

I dunno.  What do you guys think?  Worth the trouble?

Robert Varner, a past collaborator of mine, is currently working on DAQ support
for the nuclear-physics RIB facility at MSU. Many of the issues we're facing are
similar, and I think we'd benefit from collaborating with his group.

I've put up a summary of the particular issues his group is considering at:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUVpu2Tk-WFe5JXFqDyuZ7ooq_KZvELk_jI0g9XmsRw/edit#

With collaboration, we'd be able to share expertise. For example, our group is
increasingly familiar with Midas; this is a fairly common DAQ, but isn't well
represented at MSU, where they most often use an in-house DAQ. Since Robert
Varner's team needs to support the general DAQ needs of visiting users,
collaborators that bring DAQ variety might be helpful. And with collaboration,
we'd potentially be able to use some of the tools Dr. Varner's group will
eventually build.

Another possibility opened up by collaboration is the NSF SI2 grant
(http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16532/nsf16532.htm), a software infrastructure
grant. CDMS work, alone, is too specific to be a good fit for this grant, but
partnering with a more general DAQ-standards effort might be a good basis for an
SSI proposal.  I should add some forewarning, though: Robert Varner and his crew
are (nearly) all from national labs, and so can't be PIs or co-PIs for this NSF
grant.

I dunno.  What do you guys think?
