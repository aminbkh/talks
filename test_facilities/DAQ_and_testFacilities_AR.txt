### Test Facilities + DAQ #########
Building the core of the DAQ in close collaboration with the test facilities
benefits both developers and test facilities.

1. Deploying the DAQ at test facilities aggressively shakes out bugs.  Of
particular importance are bugs with long-term impact for SNOLAB; for example
the sequencer delay, and mhttpd stability.

2. Test facilities are pursuing agressive detector goals and need a DAQ.


### DAQ: short term #########
To test detectors and DCRCs, I'd assert that test facilities to be able to set up
their equipment; take science data for extended periods; and view the data, online
and offline.

While online data displays confirm that we're taking good data to disk, offline
analysis can tell us about the performance of the system. I don't think we really
know how well a DCRC works until we've got some physics plots of its data.

(A) set up detectors - SQUID and TES tuning.  I'm assuming it's okay if the
process is somewhat inconvenient.

(B) online verification - pulse display.  The labview pulse display allows users
to quickly check that the detectors are set up to take useful data.  If there are
other online views into the data that are needed, I'm not aware of them.

(C) science data-taking - automated flash and take sequence.  Data's just no good
without occasional flashing.  Does this include SQUID relocking?  I'm not sure.

(D) automated processing - automated processing of science data. By-hand
processing at test facilities are inevitably delayed at test facilities, which
house literal explosive devices. And the penalty on waiting to look at data is
steep, since adjustments are frequently needed for usable data.

(E) offline analysis - cdmsbats.  Is the data any good?  You need to view the
pulses and plot RQs to find out.

Of this list, only A, B, and C fall under DAQ jurisdiction. Items D and E likely
belong to computing.


### DAQ: long term #########
This is a whole kettle of squid that I haven't thought extensively about.  My main
(only?) point here is that if the test facilities are willing to work with us to
develop the DAQ, we'll have a solid system when we install at SNOLAB.


### Manpower: limited #########
My favorite way to deal with limited manpower is to sideline or eliminate anything
that's not critical.  But then determining the list of critical items becomes very
important.
