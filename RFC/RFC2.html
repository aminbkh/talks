What we'd really like is a private twitter.  But there is no such thing, so ... what are our options?

# IRC
IRC is an old-school chat protocol that still gets heavy use in the open-source software corner of the internet.  I think CDMS could get a password-protected channel on freenode.  (Though we may need to host our own IRC server; we'd need to find out more about security.)

Chats happen in real time: knock on the sky and see if it knocks back.  This is a platform that seems to excel with a large user base.  Utilities like archiving, searching, and email alerts require programming bots.

 Did I mention that chats happen in real time?  I mean it: comments cannot be threaded.  Also, IRC clients don't show you recent chat history when you join a channel - it's not part of the protocol to do so, man!

# Slack
Slack (slack.com) is billed as a communication solution for remote teams.  There's a free tier, but if you want to save your conversations, you need to pay.

In general, it feels like Slack offers more of a project-landing-site solution - and this includes group chat.  This is potentially great if you need a project landing site.  But there's also more stuff to wade through.    

# A private, open-source stackoverflow
For well-defined questions that need answers, it's hard to beat the Q-and-A format.  There are several open-source stackoverflow clones.

+ AskBot (https://askbot.com/, https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel)
+ Question2Answer (http://www.question2answer.org/)
+ Mamute (http://www.mamute.org/)
  + java - easy installation
  + lacks file upload

# A private, open-source reddit
Also known as: forums, but searchable and not so ugly.  As the name "discourse" suggests, this tool is meant to allow more free-form discussion than the Q-and-A format.
Discourse (http://www.discourse.org/) is a clear leader in this category.
