<h1>CDMS detectors: sensors</h1>
When a particle deposits energy in a CDMS crystal, we measure the resulting phonon excitation and ionization. These two fundamentally different signals have two fundamentally different sensors.  The ionization sensors are relatively-simple metal pads, connected to a circuit that makes them sensitive to moving charge.  The phonon sensors use a thin strip of superconducting metal to acheive exquisite sensitivity.  The temperature of the superconducting strip is held right at its critical temperature, on the sharp edge of its superconducting transition.  A SQUID circuit is used to amplify the phonon signal.

There is a single, narrower ring of lead in addition to the two outer rings; this narrow ring of lead is ancient lead.  The lead surrounds the detector; in addition to the rings of lead pictured here, there is a top and bottom cap of lead.

<th>And then there are <em>six</em> thin, copper "cans" at successively-lower temperatures.  The volume between the cans is kept under vacuum.  Standard cryostats typically have fewer hermetic temperature stages, made of stainless steel.  CDMS uses copper because low-radioactivity copper can be reliably sourced.  CDMS uses so many hermetic temperature stages because the cooling near the detectors is done not by direct contact with cryogenic fluids but instead by thermal contact with coldfingers.  This keeps the electronic noise associated with refrigeration further from the detectors, at the price of less cooling power.</th>

Shifters sit on a platform designed to allow access to the detectors.  The inner layer of polyethylene and ancient lead are just visible at the edges of the access hole.  It's difficult to see in this picture, but there are six distinct copper cans, normally each a different temperature stage.  Since the copper cans are open to the air (and all hell apparently isn't breaking loose), it's safe to say that they are all at room temperature in this image.
