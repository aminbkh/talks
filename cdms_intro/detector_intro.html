<h1>CDMS detectors: sensors</h1>
When a particle deposits energy in a CDMS crystal, we measure the resulting phonon excitation and ionization. These two fundamentally different signals have two fundamentally different sensors.  The ionization sensors are relatively-simple metal pads, connected to a circuit that makes them sensitive to moving charge.  The phonon sensors use a thin strip of superconducting metal to acheive exquisite sensitivity.  The temperature of the superconducting strip is held right at its critical temperature, on the sharp edge of its superconducting transition.  A SQUID circuit is used to amplify the phonon signal.

Standard cryostats typically have fewer hermetic temperature stages, made of stainless steel.  CDMS uses copper because low-radioactivity copper can be reliably sourced.  CDMS uses so many hermetic temperature stages because the cooling near the detectors is done not by direct contact with cryogenic fluids but instead by thermal contact with coldfingers.  This keeps the electronic noise associated with refrigeration further from the detectors, at the price of less cooling power.</div></th>

  <h1>Getting signal from the CDMS crystals out to you.</h1>
The phonon and charge sensors are made on the surface of a crystal by combining masking, etching, and film deposition techniques.  A physicist who wishes to listen to the sensors needs to create an electrically-connected path from the sensor on the surface of the crystal out to the room.
  
  The following sites contain a wealth of information about the CDMS cold hardware:
