Data Acquisition and You

Record data and explore your world.


Start by thinking about physics!

WARNING: What units should our intrepid physicists use??


What do we need to answer the physics question?
-----------------------------------------------

=== Know the shape and mass of your detector
Not the focus of this talk.

=== Know the livetime of your experiment
Incredibly simple for some experiments; moderately complex for CDMS.

=== Record what your detectors see
How you do this depends on the physics question you're asking and your detectors.  There are three basic styles of recording:

* recording discrete events
* continuous recording
* selective recording

Writing your first DAQ
----------------------
There are many (many, many) ways to write a DAQ.  Here, I illustrate one possible method.

- [line-through]#you'll want a start button# ignore - distration!
- [line-through]#and of course a stop button# ignore - distraction!
- and how will you tell it to record data from a detector?

This method is roughly similar to that of the MIDAS DAQ, which is developed by a group of physicists from PSI (a lab in Germany) and Triumf (a lab in Canada).

* edit the database to control the DAQ
* write functions that interact with your hardware
