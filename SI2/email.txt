Hi all,

I was thinking about DAQ and manpower issues, and spent some time looking around
on the Internet over winter break.

Robert Varner, a past collaborator of mine is currently working on a DAQ for the
nuclear-physics RIB facility at MSU. Many of the issues we're facing are similar,
and I think we'd benefit from collaborating with his group.

I've put up a summary of the particular issues his group is considering at:

Another possibility is the NSF SI2 grant
(http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16532/nsf16532.htm), a software infrastructure
grant.  These grants are generally awarded to projects that are applicable to an
entire field, and focuses on funding universities.  I think that partnering the
specific work CMDS is doing with a more general DAQ-standards effort might be a
good basis for an SSI proposal.  (Though I should note that this isn't necessarily
straightforward to do with Robert Varner's group, as he's at ORNL.)

I dunno.  What do you guys think?

Amy
